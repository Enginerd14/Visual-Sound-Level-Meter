# Visual-Sound-Level-Meter

A visual sound level meter is a device that uses LEDs to react to and display sound levels. 

I decided I want to make this because firstly I think they look really cool and secondly, they have a real world purpose. People listen to music too loud. There are studies linking hearing loss to earbuds use and going to concerts and being loud environment as a whole. I wanted to make this device to alet people when the environemnt is too loud and potentially damaging to their hearing.
